# CuteHome

This is CuteHome - your modular content manager / homepage engine.

It's frontend-only (no backends, databases and whatnots) and is built using [CuteFront](https://elsampsa.github.io/cutefront/_build/html/index.html) - the pure Javascript frontend framework.

Hack as you wish, remove my personal stuff, put in place yours instead and just run `deploy.sh` -> you will get a nice homepage in github pages.
