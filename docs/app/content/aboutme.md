# About Me

The name is Sampsa Riikonen. I am a (proud) father of two and the patriarch of a finnish-basque family, currently living in Helsinki, Finland. 🇫🇮

## Work

I am a software developer by trade, for the time being, working at <a href="https://www.silo.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Silo.ai</a>
as a senior AI engineer.  But wait, Silo was acquired, so in fact, now I am "Senior Member of Technical Staff" at AMD.  So for the moment, my life
is filled with debugging AMD's ROCm software stack 🎉, Pytorch and such.

In my previous life, I used to play scientist (I have a Ph. D. in Physics from a Spanish University).  Before that I did my master's in physics
in Finland's Aalto University a loong time a go (around 2003 if I remember correctly).

I belong to a class of software developers who have a severe compulsive-obsessive disorder: if I see messy/bad organized code, I just can't help
myself - I feel an obligation to clean it up, sort it out, organize and document it.  This can be both an advantage and a handicap.

Apart from pure software problems - which I get to tackle nowadays mostly on my spare time - I also try my best to keep up-to-date with the latest developments in computer (AI) vision, LLMs and all that.

### Silo

Working at Silo, I was involved in tons of projects and things: everything from implementing web backends and frontends, to classical and modern (deep-learning) machine vision.  I also did consulting gigs at various global corporations.  

### AMD

As mentioned above, now my work-life is filled with python (and sometimes even GPU kernel) debugging.

## Hobbies, etc.

In my spare time I enjoy very much climbing. 🧗 But let's be clear: I am not a climber, just a climbing *aficionado*.
In addition to climbing I do all kinds of sports - long-distance running, cycling, skiing.  I suck at all of them and I'm not the competitive type in
sports - it's just for enjoyment.

I also still play the guitar (nowadays electroacustic), an activity I started when I was just six years old, under the stern
determination of my father.  Nowadays I also sing.  My highly sought-after performances are extremely rare and limited to close circle
of family and friends.  Alcohol 🍸 is usually involved.

Yet another thing I enjoy is making ingenious & revolutionary OpenSource projects that would benefit humanity and make things
much more efficient, but which nobody uses.  So it's a typical nerd thing.  Please do check out the section about my OpenSource projects.

They say I speak fluent spanish - *pero yo no puedo opinar sobre eso*.

Ups - by now you know already too much about me..!  How about *you*?  Why are you at my homepage!?  We can continue the discussion at .. well, maybe
send me a message at linkedin.
