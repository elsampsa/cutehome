# Scientific Research

In my previous life I was a scientist.

I obtained a Ph. D. in computational materials physics in San Sebastian, Spain.  After that I did a few postdocs, in Aalto University Laboratory of Physics and in the Helsinki University laboratory of Physical Chemistry.  I also supervised a doctoral thesis.

My scientific research has touched upon several topics:

- Complex silicon surface reconstructions
- Plasmons
- Electronic properties of graphene
- Computational catalysis
- Water and ice chemistry
- Proton disorder in ice

You can find all my papers in <a href="http://scholar.google.fi/citations?user=AlI_yOgAAAAJ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Scholar</a>

My thesis is available <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/152t7nxq8v0cstt/AACAHOWngc220l3ZkuWXLSDfa?dl=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>

My Ph.D. student did a nice work in creating a software called <a href="https://github.com/pauliparkkinen/ice_package" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ice Package</a> (keywords: ice, proton disorder, configurational entropy)
