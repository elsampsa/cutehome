This is a homepage engine / content management system.

It's javascript only - no backend.  We want to host this for free in github as plain javascript code.

The framework we are using is CuteFront.  Please read cute-frontend.md in this very directory for more information.

Please read README.md in the project folder and follow the tracks to see how all this works :)

This all works.  Next steps might be: 

- Develop the homepage engine even further
- Write more stuff into my hompage
